OUT OF PLANE ARRAY

The out-of plane component is described as a sum of an out of plane line
and a parabola.
The out of plane line is the line connecting the first and last
receiver.
This line is described by the angle from the (source, first receiver)
and the out of plane line. The angle is 0 deg when the last receiver
points away from source.
The parabola has maximum in the array midpoint and a positive sag,
points away from the source for 0<angle<180 deg.
The length of the array is estimated along the parabola using first
order theory.


modifications to snap:

use snap-option
o        out of plane option.

This requires an additional line below the receiver line where 
the angle and top of parabola is specified:

127 127 10 200
45  10 

The array is at a depth of 127m has 10 elements and the length of the
array is 200 m. It has 45 deg angle to the plane and the sag is 10 m.
